# **App Name**: AgentConnect

## Core Features:

- Agent Simulation: Simulate interactions of agents using A2A, MCP, and ACP protocols to handle skill set requests.
- ANS Mock: A mock Agent Name Service (ANS) that allows agent registration and lookup with protocol extensions and timestamped records.
- Security Simulation: Simulate secure agent discovery with identity verification.
- Intelligent Skill Evaluation: An LLM tool will evaluate skill set offers based on cost, QoS, protocol compatibility, and security requirements to optimize agent selection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey reliability and interconnectedness, reflecting the protocol's function of linking agents.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to provide a clean and professional backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Subtle green (#A5D6A7) for positive confirmations and successful connection indicators.
- Clear and consistent typography.
